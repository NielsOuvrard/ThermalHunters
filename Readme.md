# Thermal Hunter

Therma Hunter is a top-down view FPS game developed in Godot Engine. The game features a unique thermal mechanic where players and weapons generate heat, which can be detected by enemies.

## Player

- Look and rotate with arrow keys `Up`, `Down`, `Left` and `Right`.
- Move with `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` OR `Z`, `Q`, `S`, `D`.
- Sprint to move faster but generate more heat, using `Shift`.
- Shoot with `Space`.
- Reload your weapon with `R`.
- Activate a thermal view to detect heat sources, using `Tab`.

## Weapons

- Fight with a variety of weapons, including a **9mm pistol**, a **shotgun**, and an **AK47**.
- Each weapon generates heat when fired, with the shotgun and AK47 generating more heat than the 9mm.

## Monsters

- The monsters in Therma Hunter are blind, but they can feel the heat.
- Monsters are attracted to heat sources, including the player's body heat and the heat generated by weapons.

## Thermal Discretion

- Manage your heat levels to avoid detection by monsters.
- Use the environment and your weapons strategically to distract monsters and escape.
